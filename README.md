## Experiment
* **Baseline**: GPT
* **Pipeline 1**: cosine similarity
* **Pipeline 2**: cosine similarity + Cross encoder re-ranking 
* **Pipeline 3**: cosine similarity + GPT re-ranking 
* **Pipeline 4**: cosine similarity + (Chain of Thought) GPT re-ranking
* **Pipeline 5**: cosine similarity + (Few-shot) GPT re-ranking
* **Pipeline 6**: cosine similarity + (Chain of Thought + Few-shot) GPT re-ranking
