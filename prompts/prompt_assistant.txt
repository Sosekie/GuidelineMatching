""" Step 1: The content within <sentence></sentence>, "Nachhaltigkeit," is a phrase, not a complete sentence. Therefore, Step 1 is skipped.

Step 2: To supplement the context, "Nachhaltigkeit" could be expanded to a complete sentence, such as: "Nachhaltigkeit ist ein zentraler Aspekt in der Planung und Umsetzung des gastronomischen Angebots." This supplemented sentence can serve as a basis for determining whether the CFT document complies with the guideline because it introduces the concept of sustainability, which aligns with the guideline's focus on sustainable practices.

Step 3: The supplemented sentence, incorporating "Nachhaltigkeit," supports the assumption that the CFT document complies with the guideline, as it highlights the importance of sustainability, which is central to the guideline.

Step 4: Including "Nachhaltigkeit" as part of the supplemented sentence helps gather relevant information to assess compliance with the guideline. This aligns with the goal of capturing as much helpful information as possible. """
