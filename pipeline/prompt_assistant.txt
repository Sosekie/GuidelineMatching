Matching Analysis
Candidate Text 1: "The catering company's menu contains at least half of the dishes as vegetarian every day."
This text has the same subject as the reference text (the catering company) and explicitly mentions the vegetarian proportion as "at least half," which fully matches the requirement in the reference text. Therefore, it is retained.

Candidate Text 2: "This catering company guarantees a diverse range of vegetarian options every day, including tofu and vegetables."
Although this text is related to "the catering company" and "vegetarian dishes," it does not mention the proportion of vegetarian dishes among all dishes. Therefore, it is irrelevant to the reference text's requirement of a vegetarian proportion and is eliminated.

Candidate Text 3: "The catering company provides 50 vegetarian dishes every day, of which 20 are organic."
This text describes the quantity of vegetarian dishes but does not mention the proportion of vegetarian dishes among all dishes, making it impossible to determine if it meets the reference text's requirements regarding proportion. Therefore, it is eliminated.

Candidate Text 4: "This company focuses on providing healthy food, especially gluten-free and low-fat options."
This text is irrelevant to the proportion of vegetarian dishes. Therefore, it is eliminated.

Candidate Text 5: "40% of the dishes provided by the catering company every day are vegetarian, while 60% are non-vegetarian."
This text has the same subject as the reference text and describes the proportion of vegetarian dishes. Although the proportion is 40%, which contradicts the reference text's "at least 50%" requirement, it is still directly related to the vegetarian proportion. Therefore, it is retained.
